Strange but interesting little things

## Questions

#### What is this?

Sometimes I think about some crazy ideas of different things in JavaScript.  
Here's the place when I'll group them up and share with you.

#### Can I contribute?

**No.**

#### Is it another nano-library?

**No.** I want to keep my thoughts in as simple and concise view as possible so I'll break my traditions and use all ES6+ features here. I'll add transpiled build, don't worry about that

#### How many things you will do?

**I don't know.** This will happen spontaneously and unpredictable.
